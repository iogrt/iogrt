### ✨ FOSS Software I highly recommend:

- [**Lazygit**](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), an intuitive and simple git client
- [**XMonad**](https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad), a window manager configurable in Haskell
- [**NixOS**](https://nixos.org/), config file based OS, highly reproducible
